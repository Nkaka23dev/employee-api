# Employee API  

## About the Project  

This is an **ASP.NET Core** employee management system built with **C#** and **.NET**. The project currently uses an **SQLite** database for development, but it can be switched to **Postgres** for production environments. It  will provides basic employee management features such as handling employee benefits, leave requests, performance reviews, and payroll.

## Already Implemented Featuresâœ…

- **Create Employee**: Ability to add new employees to the system, with required validation and data integrity checks.
- **Update Employee**: Modify employee details, with validation and logging of changes.

- **Get Employees**: Endpoint to retrieve employees with support for:
  - **Pagination**: Get a specific number of employees per page.
  - **Filtering**: Filter employees based on various criteria (e.g., name, department, job title).

- **Employee Validation**: Validation of employee data on creation and update to ensure data integrity.

- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of actions such as employee creation, updates, and deletions for auditing and debugging purposes.

- **Delete Employee**: Remove employees from the system with proper validation and checks.
- **Unit Testing**: for current implemented features
- **Data Seeding**: when the project start two employee are added by default.
- **API Documentation**: Automatically generated Swagger documentation for all employee-related endpoints, providing detailed information about available

## TODO  ðŸš€  

- You can start by improving already implemented features if you see something to improve for example using **AutoMapper** in the **EmployeeController** for object-to-object mapping.
- Implement **authentication and authorization** (with access and refresh tokens) ==> âœ…In progess...
- Migrate from **SQLite** to **Postgres** for production.  
- Implement **CRUD operations** for employee benefits (**[Table reference](https://github.com/Nkaka23dev/employee-api/blob/2070366409f04be52f8d7528011508a6831ea5f7/TheEmployeeAPI/Domain/Entities/Employee/Employee.cs#L25)**).  
- Add **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment(Optional include versioning with semantic release)  
- **Dockerize** the API for containerized deployment.    
- Allow employees to **upload documents**, such as IDs and images.  
- Implement **account verification** via email and **Google login**.  
- âœ… **Write unit tests** for every newly added feature to ensure code quality.

## More advance Todo Features ðŸŽ¯  

The API now should include:  
- **Leave Requests**: Allow employees to submit leave requests.  
- **Performance Reviews**: Track and manage performance evaluations for employees.  
- **Payroll Management**: Record and manage payroll details.  
- **Training Management**: Manage training programs and employee enrollments.  
- **Time Tracking**: Track employee working hours.  
- **User Roles**: Role-based access for admins, managers, and employees.


## Proposed Entity Descriptions ðŸ—‚  

- **Employees**: The core entity; nearly all other entities are related to employees.  
- **EmployeeBenefits**: Each employee can have multiple associated benefits.  
- **LeaveRequests**: Employees can request leave, and each employee can have multiple leave requests.  
- **PerformanceReviews**: Employees can have multiple performance reviews over time.  
- **Payroll**: Each employee has one payroll record per payment period.  
- **Trainings & EmployeeTrainings**: Employees can enroll in multiple training programs.

## Getting Started ðŸ›   

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **.NET SDK** (version 9.0 or later)  
- **Entity Framework (EF Core)**  
- **PostgreSQL** (optional, if migrating from SQLite)
- **NuGet Gallery** VSCode extention(Optional)

### Setup Instructions  
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nkaka23dev/employee-api.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd employee-api

# Restore the required packages
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Navigate to TheEmployeeAPI
cd TheEmployeeAPI

# Run the project locally
dotnet run
```

#### Useful commands:
```ts
 - dotnet build //Build the project
 - dotnet test //Running tests
 - dotnet run  //Starting the project
 - dotnet ef migrations add --file-name //Creating new migration
 - dotnet ef database update //Modified database with new migration

 ```
#### Filtering and Pagination example:
```ts
 http://localhost:5229/employee/all?page=2&RequestPerPage=3&FirstNameContains={firstname}&LastNameContains={lastname}
 ```
- Unit test included using  
```bash
 - XUnit
 - Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi Version=9.0.2
 ```
 - API endpoints are validated using FluentValidation
 ```bash
   -  dotnet add package FluentValidation
 ```
 ```ts
    You can also use NuGet to add this package throught the VScode UI.
 ```
 ```ts
    Use AutoMapper to similate object.assing()
   ```
- To including ILogger mocks while testing we can mock ILogger interface. You can use one of the following libries: 
```bash
 - Moq
 - ILogger.Moq
 - ILogger.Log
 ```
